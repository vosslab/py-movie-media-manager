# Changelog

## 2026-02-27

### Additions and New Features
- Created `moviemanager/ui/workers.py` with `Worker` and `ImageDownloadWorker` QRunnable
  classes for running network/IO operations off the main thread
- Added image preview in `ImageChooserDialog` that downloads and displays thumbnails
  asynchronously when a URL is selected
- Added drag-and-drop support on `MainWindow` to accept directory drops for scanning
- Added window geometry and state persistence via `QSettings` (save on close, restore on open)
- Added toolbar icons using `QStyle.standardIcon()` for Open, Scrape, Edit, Rename, Settings
- Added tooltips to all toolbar buttons showing action name and keyboard shortcut
- Added template variable help text below Path Template and File Template fields in Settings
- Added "No results found" feedback label in `MovieChooserDialog` when TMDB returns zero results
- When GUI launches without a directory argument, it now prompts the user to open a folder

### Behavior or Interface Changes
- Moved directory scanning, TMDB search, movie scraping, and artwork downloading to background
  threads using `QThreadPool` and `Worker` classes to prevent UI freezing
- Changed Scrape shortcut from `Ctrl+S` to `Ctrl+Shift+S` to avoid conflict with
  standard Save convention
- Added `F2` keyboard shortcut for Rename action
- Connected `returnPressed` signal on search and year fields in `MovieChooserDialog` so
  pressing Enter triggers a search
- Extended movie table filter to match against year, genres, and director in addition to title
- Changed plot text area height from fixed 120px max to 80-300px range for better readability
- Set interactive column resize mode on movie table so users can manually adjust column widths
- Replaced TMDB ID `QLineEdit` with `QSpinBox` in movie editor to prevent non-numeric input
- Enhanced About dialog to show version from `pyproject.toml`, author, and license info

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Fixed `_rename_selected()` silently returning when no movie is selected; now shows
  "Please select a movie first" message like Scrape and Edit do
- Added error handling (`QMessageBox.critical`) around all network/API calls at the UI boundary
  to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the app
- Added unsaved-changes guard on movie editor Cancel: compares current field values to
  original snapshot and shows "Discard changes?" confirmation when dirty
- Added overwrite confirmation dialog before downloading artwork that would replace
  an existing file
- Added transient status bar messages ("Scan complete", "Scrape complete", "Rename complete",
  "Metadata saved") with 3-second timeout after successful operations
- Moved `time.sleep(random.random())` rate limiting from main thread into background
  download worker to prevent UI freezing

- Created `tests/test_no_pyside6_in_core.py` import guard (24 tests) verifying core/scraper/api
  never import PySide6
- Added `tests/test_scraper_imdb.py` (6 tests) and `tests/test_scraper_fanart.py` (4 tests)
- Wired CLI end-to-end: `scan`, `scrape`, `rename`, and `info` subcommands fully functional
- `movie_api.py`: `search_movie()` calls `TmdbScraper.search()`, `scrape_movie()` fetches
  metadata and writes Kodi NFO, `rename_movie()` delegates to `renamer.rename_movie()`
- `cmd_scrape`: interactive or batch TMDB search with result table and NFO writing
- `cmd_rename`: preview table with dry-run default, confirmation prompt, and file move execution
- `cmd_info`: now shows poster and fanart artwork counts

- Added `tests/test_scanner.py` (8), `tests/test_renamer.py` (7), `tests/test_scraper_tmdb.py` (7),
  `tests/test_cli.py` (5)
- Updated `tests/conftest.py` to use `git_file_utils.get_repo_root()`

### Fixes and Maintenance
- Removed unnecessary shebangs from library and test modules
- Fixed `conftest.py` to use `git_file_utils.get_repo_root()` instead of path derivation
- Fixed `imdb` import alias in `test_import_requirements.py` to map to `cinemagoer`
- Fixed mixed indentation and unused imports in `test_cli_integration.py` and `test_scanner.py`

### Behavior or Interface Changes
- `cmd_scrape` and `cmd_rename` are no longer placeholder stubs
- `scrape_movie()` converts `CastMember` dataclasses to dicts for NFO writer compatibility

### Decisions and Failures
- CLI uses argparse subcommands (scan, info, scrape, rename) per repo style
- Used `requests` directly for Fanart.tv instead of vendoring `python3-fanart`
- PySide6 is a required dependency, not optional
- Backend/frontend separation enforced by `test_no_pyside6_in_core.py` import guard

  PySide6, pyyaml, requests, rich, tabulate, tmdbv3api
- Added `pytest-qt` to `pip_requirements-dev.txt`
- Added `tests/test_nfo_round_trip.py` and `tests/test_filename_parser.py`

### Decisions and Failures
- Chose CalVer `26.02b1` as initial version
- NFO files are single source of truth, no database
- Using PyPI packages (`tmdbv3api`, `cinemagoer`) instead of custom scrapers
- Backend (core/, scraper/) never imports PySide6
